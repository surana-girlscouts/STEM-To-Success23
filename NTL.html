<h2>STEM To Success</h2>

<p>Newton's Third Law states that for every action, there is an opposite and equal reaction. But what does this mean? Newton's Third Law relates to a force on object A and by object B being equal to the same force on object B and by object A. For example, if 2 boxes are touching, the normal force on box A and by box B is equal to the normal force on box B and by box A.</p>

<h4>Answer the following questions to test your understanding.</h4>

  <div class = "thirtyeight"><text class="text">Boxes A and B are set motionless on a floor, and they are touching each other.</text>
   <p></p>
  <img src = "Website13.png">
   <p></p>
  <text>>Which is the correct force diagram for Box A in this situation?</text>
   <p></p>
        <button class = "fdc"><img src = "Website14.png"></button>
        <button class = "fdi"><img src = "Website15.png"></button></div>
      <p></p>
    <div class = "thirtynine hidden"><text class="text">Correct.</text></div>
    <div class = "forty hidden"><text class="text">Incorrect. Due to the surface of Box B touching the surface of Box A, a normal force is being applied on Box A by Box B.</text></div>
  <p></p>
    <div class = "fortyone hidden"><text>Boxes A and B are still touching each other, and a hand is pushing Box A this time.</text>
    <p></p>
  <img src = "Website16.png">
  <p></p>
  <text>Which is the correct force diagram for Box B in this situation?</text>
    <p></p>
    <button class = "fdtc"><img src = "Website17.png"></button>
    <button class = "fdti"><img src = "Website18.png"></button></div>
    <p></p>
      <div class = "fortytwo hidden"><text class="text">Correct.</text></div>
      <div class = "fortythree hidden"><text>Incorrect. There is no applied force on Box B because the hand is only touching Box A.</text></div>
    <p></p>
  <div class = "fortyfour hidden"><text class="text">Boxes A and B are set motionless on a floor, and they are connected by a rope.</text>

  <p></p>
      <div class = "fortyfive hidden"><text>Correct.</text></div>
      <div class = "fortysix hidden"><text>Incorrect. It is important to remember that a rope usually has the same force of tension throughout.</text></div>
